## OAuth Lite for Java
_A lightweight, extensible, dependency-less library for OAuth with multiple default providers_

# Why?
Because I commonly end up reimplementing the same protocols for different projects and using each specific providers libraries (e.g. MSAL) require a lot of dependencies. The goal of this library is to allow anyone to easily implement the OAuth protocols for **any** provider with minimal setup and dependencies.

# How do I add it to my project?
